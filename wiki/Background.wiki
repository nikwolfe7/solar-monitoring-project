=== Why Build This? ===

Why design a solar monitoring system? Indeed, such products are already on the market. The problem, I believe, with existing solar monitoring systems is that they are limited in their application, are expensive, and in most cases require paying service fees to a third party (above and beyond the cost of basic communication). This sort of system can and should be built using non-custom hardware that can be easily obtained and open-source software that can run anywhere. 

There are many applications for a system like this. Monitoring a solar power array is just one of the possibilities. Practically any device with measurable outputs running in a remote environment represents a potential future extension of this project. And, because this is open-source, anyone who would like to take this project and modify it for their own purposes is free and encouraged to do so. This project provides a general platform for further applications and I hope that many people will benefit from the ideas recorded on these pages. 

=== The Bigger Picture ===

In general, solar monitoring is a useful idea. As the world's energy economy gradually evolves towards greener and more renewable sources of energy, power generation will become more [http://www.oe.energy.gov/1165.htm decentralized]. In contrast to the current system of large, centralized coal-fire power plants servicing vast regions of energy consumers, the energy infrastructure of the future will see many different forms of power generation taking root wherever the demand and the will exists. Power will not come from 10 or 20 major locations, it will come from potentially thousands--solar arrays on the roofs of office buildings, wind turbines on the perimeters of farmland, or steam turbines on remote geothermal vents--just to name a few. 

Coordinating such a vast system will prove quite unwieldly without a robust monitoring infrastructure. The ability to measure spot and regional performance is of critical importance if the power of decentralized generation is to be harnessed and the grid is to in fact become "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_grid smarter]". 

A real world example of this evolution towards decentralized power generation is Denmark. In the last 20 or so years the Danish energy grid has gone from a few large power plants to a vast collection of wind turbines and alternative energy sites all over the country. Denmark now generates almost 20% of its energy from wind! 

As expected, the Danish wind turbine grid requires a vast monitoring system. Today, with the help of remote senors, wind turbines in Denmark are capable of being [http://www.investindk.com/visNyhed.asp?artikelID=21866 monitored] for diagnostic information as minute as the unique vibration pattern of an individual turbine blade. The Danish energy economy is a shining example of both the benefits of decentralization and making the grid smarter through monitoring. 

The United States, unfortunately, is far behind Denmark and most of the developed world as far as renewable energy is concerned. Solar and wind technologies have yet to reach the critical mass required for widespread adoption. It is also too expensive without the assistance of energy incentives from utilities. This might be one explanation for the lack of diversity and robustness in monitoring systems. 

This project is an attempt to spur thought and innovation on the use of existing out-of-the-box technologies to accomplish the task of remote monitoring. An open-source development approach, furthermore, is preferable in this situation because it is not large companies, government bodies, or utilities that are making respectable strides towards the adoption of renewable energy--by and large, it is individuals who are leading the way. I want to support these efforts and assist people taking the initiative to go green. 

I discuss my approach to solving the simple case here.

=== My Original Inspiration ===

I have discussed the importance of monitoring decentralized energy production and the myriad applications for this project in the coming "smart" grid revolution. I have not, however, talked about the individual application that inspired my decision to create this project in the form that I am pursuing. To do that, some background is required. 

Solar energy can be an attractive alternative to the grid in places where such infrastructure is inadequate or nonexistent. In Sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, more than 60% of the population has no access to electricity. Furthermore, this state of affairs is perpetuated by underdevelopment and the general lack of capital resources required to expand the electrical grid in many African countries. 

Now, short of a discussion on the causes for such underdevelopment or the potentially problematic assertion that electricity is the solution to poverty, suffice it to say that the status quo has prompted many charity organizations and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) to use solar energy in their humanitarian projects. Solar energy is good for such applications as lighting and running efficient appliances, and it can offer a sustainable source of energy for important community infrastructure like schools and hospitals. 

Sustainability is an interesting concept in this regard, because it is almost always overlooked. Off the bat, solar energy falls flat on its face as a good investment for poor and rural communities because it is astronomically expensive for the economic yields it returns. It is quite simply a material impossibility to afford in most situations. Thus, in the vast majority of cases where solar energy finds its way into electrically-deprived communities in Sub-Saharan Africa, it is only through the work of international charity organizations. Until there is a massive drop in the price-per-watt for solar energy, this is likely to continue. 

One of the major problems with the introduction of expensive and potentially complicated technology in underdeveloped communities is the concept of cost after installation. Once a new piece of infrastructure is in place, a cost is introduced with respect to its maintenance. For example, if a solar array is installed on the roof of a school, somebody has to look after it. That person's time and skill-set are valuable. Stand-alone solar arrays actually require a certain amount of discipline to maintain, and some degree of specialized training and knowledge of electrical power systems is a must. How can an already impoverished community afford such expenses? And where does the knowledge come from?

Conventionally, this gap is filled by the organization undertaking the responsibility to install the solar power system, or not at all. (For more information on this phenomenon, please read my [http://solar-monitoring-project.googlecode.com/files/Renewable%20Energy%20in%20Africa.pdf research paper].) In general, humanitarian projects involving solar technology fail. The specific reasons vary, but it tends to be the case that development organizations fail to plan for the problems of cost after installation. Knowledge is not transferred, and the tools required to maintain a solar power system are not provided. Thus, solar arrays are unintentionally misused, batteries are depleted, and the systems eventually stop functioning. 

The other side of the coin is when development organizations take it upon themselves to maintain the power system by sending trained personnel to look after the solar array periodically or by maintaining staff at the site. This is an enormously problematic approach and fails to empower the community of interest. It's also extremely unsustainable, expensive, and essentially begs the whole development question in the first place. What development has occurred if a solar power system requires a life-long maintenance commitment on the part of the original installer? It's the moral equivalent of being able to stay in business by buying your own goods.
