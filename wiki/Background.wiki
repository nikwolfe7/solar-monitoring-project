=== Why Build This? ===

Why design a solar monitoring system? Indeed, such products are already exist on the market. The problem, I believe, with existing solar monitoring systems is that they are limited in their application, are expensive, and in most cases require paying service fees to a third party (above and beyond the cost of basic communication). This sort of system can and should be built using non-custom hardware that can be easily obtained and open-source software that can run anywhere. 

There are many applications for a system like this. Monitoring a solar power array is just one of the possibilities. Practically any device with measurable outputs running in a remote environment represents a potential future extension of this project. And, because this is open-source, anyone who would like to take this project and modify it for their own purposes is free and encouraged to do so. This project provides a general platform for further applications and I hope many people will benefit from the ideas recorded on these pages. 

=== The Bigger Picture ===

In general, remote monitoring is a useful idea. As the world's energy economy gradually evolves towards greener and more renewable sources of energy, power generation will become more [http://www.oe.energy.gov/1165.htm decentralized]. Renewable energy sources are in many ways like mineral resources--they are regional. Sunlight and wind, for instance, vary in their reliability from place to place, and therefore the choice of where to build power systems is as much a function of geography as it is of economics. In contrast to the current system of large, centralized power plants servicing vast regions of energy consumers, the energy infrastructure of the future will see many different forms of power generation taking root wherever the demand exists. Power will not come from 10 or 20 major locations, it will come from potentially thousands. Instead of an enormous coal-fire plant for an entire city, the power of the future will come from solar arrays on the roofs of office buildings, wind turbines on the perimeters of farmland, and steam turbines on remote geothermal vents, just to name a few of the possibilities. 

Coordinating such a vast system will prove impossible without a robust monitoring infrastructure. The ability to measure spot and regional performance is of critical importance if the power of decentralized generation is to be harnessed and the grid is to in fact become "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_grid smarter]". 

A real world example of this evolution towards decentralized power generation is Denmark. In the last 20 or so years the Danish energy grid has been transformed from a few large power plants to a vast collection of wind turbines and alternative energy sites all over the country. Denmark now generates 20% of its energy from wind! 

As expected, the Danish wind grid requires a vast monitoring system. Today, with the help of remote senors, wind turbines in Denmark are capable of being [http://www.investindk.com/visNyhed.asp?artikelID=21866 monitored] for diagnostic information as minute as the unique vibration pattern of an individual turbine blade. The Danish energy economy is a shining example of both the benefits of decentralization and making the grid smarter through remote monitoring. 

The United States, unfortunately, is far behind Denmark and most of the developed world as far as renewable energy is concerned. Solar and wind technologies have yet to reach the critical mass required for widespread adoption. It is also too expensive without the assistance of energy incentives from utilities. This might be one explanation for the lack of diversity and robustness in monitoring systems. 

This project is an attempt to spur thought and innovation on the use of existing out-of-the-box technologies to accomplish the task of remote monitoring. An open-source development approach, furthermore, is preferable in this situation because it is not large companies, government bodies, or utilities that are making respectable strides towards the adoption of renewable energy--by and large, it is still individuals who are leading the way. I want to support these efforts and assist people taking the initiative to go green. 

I discuss my approach to solving the simple case here.

=== My Original Inspiration ===

I have discussed the importance of monitoring decentralized energy production and the myriad applications for this project in the coming "smart grid" revolution. I have not, however, talked about the individual application that inspired my decision to pursue this project. To do that, some background is required. 

==== Solar Energy and International Development ====

Renewable energy can be an attractive alternative to the grid in places where such infrastructure is inadequate or nonexistent. In Sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, more than 60% of the population has no access to electricity. In the conventional interest of development and poverty reduction, the question of how to provide modern energy services to this enormous proportion of the population is of critical importance. As many African governments have proven incapable or unwilling to tackle this issue, the general consensus of the development community at large has been to emphasize the dissemination of renewable energy technologies to rural areas. This focus on localized power generation has led to the implementation of a variety of developmental strategies and programs, not the least of which is the use of solar technology to provide generally inaccessible communities with electrical power for lighting, communication, and other applications. 

Now, short of a discussion on the causes of underdevelopment in Africa or the potentially problematic assertion that electricity is necessarily the solution to poverty, suffice it to say that the status quo has prompted many charity and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to utilize solar energy in their humanitarian development projects. The argument, broadly, is that solar energy provides a sustainable source of power for important community infrastructure like schools and hospitals. 

==== Theory and Practice ====

Sustainability is an interesting concept in this regard, because it is almost always bungled in practice. Off the bat, solar energy falls flat on its face as a good investment for poor and rural communities because it is astronomically expensive given the economic yields it can return. It is quite simply a material impossibility to afford in most situations. Thus, in the vast majority of cases where solar energy finds its way into electrically-deprived communities in Sub-Saharan Africa, it is only through the work of international charity organizations. Until there is a massive drop in the price-per-watt for solar energy, this is likely to continue. 

One of the major problems with the introduction of expensive and potentially complicated technology into underdeveloped communities is the concept of cost after installation. Once a new piece of infrastructure is in place, a cost is introduced into the community with respect to its maintenance. For example, if a solar array is installed on the roof of a school, somebody has to look after it. That person's time and skill-set are valuable, and must be paid for. Stand-alone solar arrays actually require a certain amount of discipline to maintain, and some degree of specialized training and knowledge of electrical power systems are a must. But how can an already impoverished community afford such expenses? And where does the knowledge come from?

Conventionally, this gap is filled by the organization undertaking the responsibility to install the solar power system, or, in some cases, not at all. (For more information on this phenomenon, please read my [http://solar-monitoring-project.googlecode.com/files/Renewable%20Energy%20in%20Africa.pdf research paper].) One woeful and all too common approach is the establishment of effectively permanent international fund-raising schemes or the periodic maintenance of a given development project by NGO personnel themselves. This is an enormously problematic approach precisely because it fails to empower the community of interest. It's also extremely unsustainable, expensive, completely neglects the role of community stakeholders, and essentially begs the whole development question in the first place. ([http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118941548/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 Missionary] organizations are the most pernicious in this category of short-sighted development tactics.) What development has occurred if, for instance, the proper functioning of a solar power system requires a life-long maintenance commitment on the part of the original installer? It's the moral equivalent of being able to stay in business by buying your own goods. 

==== The Bottom Line ====

In general, humanitarian projects involving solar technology fail. (Development projects overall do not have a very impressive success record, however, I am attempting to focus here on the subset of those projects that involve renewable energy systems.) The specific reasons for failure vary, but it tends to be the case that development organizations neglect to plan for the problems of cost after installation. They do not transfer the knowledge required to sustain their projects, and true community stakeholders are for all practical purposes nonexistent. Quite naively, solar power systems are often expected to run without maintenance. As a result, these systems are unintentionally misused, their batteries are depleted, and they eventually stop functioning altogether. 

I stress the latter point not only because I think it is a pervasive problem among development organizations, but also because I have witnessed it first hand. In the summer of 2007 I had the opportunity to travel to a small town called Sanyang in The Gambia. In this town, a Belgian NGO had erected a rather large solar array to power a water pump for a local health clinic. I was informed that this pump was no longer working. Upon inspection, it appeared that a fuse had blown after the pump voltage surged as a result of running dry in the well. While I cannot confirm this diagnosis, the critical point is that nobody in the community was given any direction as to what to do in such a situation by the NGO that built this system. Not even a manual was left behind! The solar array was sitting idle in the sun, and the health clinic was using hand-pumped water carried to the site in buckets. 

The picture below is from that health clinic, and the empty water tank attached to the aforementioned ill-fated water pump is in the background.

Situations like this are all too common in the aftermath of short-sighted development projects, and must be rectified if such efforts are to be taken seriously. A sustainable project is more than the hip photo-op aesthetics of a solar array in a small African town. True sustainability must consider the economic impact of the introduction of technological infrastructure, and have sustainable financing schemes built in to account for both the cost of maintenance and the training of community stakeholders. Anything less is a waste of time and money.

Let me be clear on this latter point. If a solar power system is used in a development project, the transferring of knowledge to local stakeholders on the utilization and maintenance of that system is an absolutely indispensable part of the project's long-term success. Remote monitoring can, however, serve as an excellent tool to assist in the maintenance process. *This project is not in any way a substitute for proper training on the maintenance of a solar power system.* If available, however, the chances of success are greatly enhanced by the use of a remote monitoring system because of the quality of information, flexibility, and transparency it can provide. The emphasis I place on minimizing after-the-fact costs should become clearer at this juncture. 

Solar arrays have an enormous up-front cost that tends to be absorbed by development organizations. After the initial investment, if properly planned, a renewable energy system should facilitate income-generating activities. These activities will have to produce enough revenue to account for the costs of maintenance. As the use of a solar monitoring system would become one of those costs (an advisable consideration in my opinion), it needs to be cheap. Thus, open source technology is the way to go, because under no circumstances will a proprietary system or third-party service ever be cheap enough. It furthermore undermines the purpose of such development projects in the first place, because it neglects the role of stakeholders and creates an unsustainable link between the community of interest and a company that's likely to be thousands of miles away. The cost of a monitoring system in this case must be little more than the cost of communication (i.e. the use of the air waves). That is my intention with this project and here is how I intend to do it. 

==== Personal Experience ====

So how did this idea occur to me? Well, the answer to that is related to why I was in the Gambia in the summer of 2007 in the first place. I was helping to build a new high school in the town of Sanyang and my primary contribution to the project was the procuring of resources and training of community stakeholders on the use of a solar power system to provide the school with electricity. I'm sure everything in the preceding paragraphs makes a ton more sense now. 

Making an incredibly long story short, the solar controller we used for the solar system was donated to us by a company called [http://www.morningstarcorp.com/en/home Morningstar Solar]. It happened to contain a serial RS-232 port that enabled a cellular modem to interface with it and transmit data about the solar power system wirelessly to a remote server. And, unsurprisingly, Morningstar encourages the users of their controllers to interface with their devices in this way. They even offer a remote monitoring service through a third-party that you can pay a pretty penny for. I instantly thought, "Wow, what a useful way to keep up on the progress of the school's power system!" Not only could you do long-term system analysis and telemetry, you could provide the system's local overseers with an easy means to keep up with the progress of the solar array from anywhere, anytime. 

So I looked into the details and found out that the cellular modem required to monitor the solar controller was a whopping $700. And, the fancy web interface provided by the third-party monitoring company would cost about $50 a month. This made the entire thing a non-starter, but I never stopped thinking how useful it would be if you could monitor the solar array remotely. Furthermore, it seemed like such a simple task. Serial communication is not exactly high technology. Cellular telephony is not space-aged, either. Why is it so expensive?

The answer to that is related to the reason that solar panels themselves are so damn expensive to begin with. The demand for solar energy is incredibly high, but there are precious few companies actually mass-producing solar panels. The number of places where a remote monitoring system would make sense is relatively small. And, because solar monitoring is a fairly specialized task, the hardware used by companies that offer telemetry services is often proprietary and customized. So, the combination of solar energy being expensive to begin with and the fact that the application is limited, the price for solar monitoring systems is basically inflated. 

Another problem with existing solar monitoring systems is the fact that they actually require an external power source to run the hardware component. Some solar controllers actually use Ethernet cables to transfer data. A remote, off-grid system where power is scarce can afford neither of these requirements. Another issue arises, however. Where are the cellular networks in places without electricity?

In many parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, recent cellular infrastructural developments have resulted in places with no reliable electrical grid actually being within the range of cell towers. (The paradoxical consequence of this is the fact that you could technically talk on a cell phone but never be able to charge it.) That said, a rural school or hospital running on solar energy is in fact very likely to have a cellular signal. So, remote monitoring via cellular communication can work in Africa. 

==== Final Thoughts ====

At this point, I've discussed most of the background required to understand the basis and motivation for this project. I want to build an open-source remote monitoring system that uses no customized hardware and software that can run anywhere it is installed. I want to completely eliminate the overhead of paying a third party for monitoring services or using an over-priced custom transmitter. This is a simple problem if money and technological constraints were no object. It becomes an altogether more complicated matter to construct this system with off-the-shelf equipment. But, a little elbow grease and old-fashioned circuit-bending hackery should do the trick, I think. 

At least that's my goal. We'll see what happens...
