=== Why Build This? ===

Why design a solar monitoring system? Indeed, such products are already on the market. The problem with existing solar monitoring systems is that they are limited in their application, are expensive, and require paying a third party for services. My contention is that this sort of system can and should be built using non-custom hardware that can be easily obtained and open-source software that can run anywhere.
