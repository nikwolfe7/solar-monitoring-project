== My Original Inspiration ==

In my [Motivation motivation] page I discussed the relevance of remote monitoring in the context of green technology and smart grids. Here, I discuss some of the issues that lead to my original inspiration to create this project. 

=== Solar Energy and International Development ===

(More information on this topic can be found [http://solar-monitoring-project.googlecode.com/files/Renewable%20Energy%20in%20Africa.pdf here].)

Renewable energy can be an attractive alternative to the grid in places where such infrastructure is inadequate or nonexistent. In Sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, more than 60% of the population has no access to electricity. In the conventional interest of development and poverty reduction, the question of how to provide modern energy services to this enormous proportion of the population is of critical importance. As many African governments have proven incapable or unwilling to tackle this issue, the general consensus of the development community at large has been to emphasize the dissemination of renewable energy technologies to rural areas. This focus on localized power generation has led to the implementation of a variety of developmental programs involving the use of solar technology to provide generally inaccessible communities with electrical power for community infrastructure like schools and hospitals. 

Now, short of making the problematic assertion that electricity is a solution to poverty, I will suffice it to say that the status quo has prompted many charity and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to use solar energy systems in conjunction with their humanitarian development efforts. It is with this context in mind that I will frame my assertions on sustainable best practices in development and the role of remote monitoring in renewable energy projects. 

=== Theory and Practice ===

Sustainability is an ironic topic in the field of humanitarian development projects because it is so often emphasized in theory but almost always bungled in practice. Consider the theoretical benefits of renewable energy systems versus the practicality of their application: Right off the bat, solar energy falls flat on its face as a sensible investment for poor and rural communities because it is astronomically expensive given the economic yields it can return through income-generating activities. In most situations it is simply a material impossibility to afford. Thus, in the vast majority of cases where solar energy actually finds its way into the hands of otherwise underdeveloped and impoverished communities in Sub-Saharan Africa, it is only through the work of international charity organizations. As a result of this dependency, the sustainability of development projects involving solar power systems is tenuous. Solar energy may provide a theoretical source of clean, renewable, and essentially "free" electricity, but its initial cost is so high that it requires external intervention.

Moreover, one of the major problems with the introduction of expensive and potentially complicated technology into underdeveloped communities is the concept of cost after installation. Once a new piece of infrastructure is in place, a permanent maintenance cost has also been introduced. For example, if a solar array is installed on the roof of a school, somebody has to look after it. That person's time and skill-set are going to cost money because the maintenance of a stand-alone solar array requires specialized training and knowledge of electrical power systems. But how can an already impoverished community afford such expenses? And where does the knowledge come from?

Again, we are faced with the inherently unsustainable notion of external dependency. Conventionally, when development organizations have tried to fill the knowledge gap I refer to here, they do so in patently unsustainable ways, or not at all. (For more information on this topic, please read my [http://solar-monitoring-project.googlecode.com/files/Renewable%20Energy%20in%20Africa.pdf research paper].) Some common approaches to nurture development projects after their inception include the establishment of effectively permanent international fund-raising schemes (think [http://www.worldvision.org/ World Vision]) or periodically sending NGO personnel to maintain a given project themselves (think [http://www.invisiblechildren.com/home.php Invisible Children]). Such strategies are enormously problematic precisely because they are indicative of a failure to thoroughly consider how best to sustainably empower the community of interest. They are also extremely expensive, completely neglect the role of community stakeholders, and essentially beg the whole development question in the first place. ([http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118941548/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 Missionary] organizations are notoriously guilty of such short-sighted development tactics.) What lasting and truly sustainable development has actually occurred if, for instance, the proper functioning of a solar power system requires a life-long maintenance commitment on the part of its original installer? It's the moral equivalent of trying to stay in business by buying your own goods. 

=== The Bottom Line ===

In general, humanitarian projects involving solar technology fail. (Development projects overall do not have a very impressive success record, however, I am attempting to focus here on the subset of those projects that involve renewable energy systems.) The specific reasons for failure vary, but it tends to be the case that development organizations neglect to plan for the problems of cost after installation. They do not transfer the knowledge required to sustain their projects, and community stakeholders are generally left by the wayside. Furthermore, solar power systems are often naively expected to run without maintenance. As a result, these systems are unintentionally misused, their batteries are depleted, and they eventually stop functioning altogether. 

I want to stress the latter point not only because I think it is a pervasive problem among development organizations, but also because I have witnessed it first hand. In the summer of 2007 I had the opportunity to travel to a small town called Sanyang in The Gambia. In this town, a Belgian NGO had erected a rather large solar array to power a water pump for a local health clinic. I was informed that this pump was no longer working. Upon inspection, it appeared that a fuse had blown after the pump voltage surged as a result of running dry in the well. While I cannot confirm this diagnosis, the critical point is that nobody in the community was given any direction whatsoever as to what to do in such a situation by the NGO that built this system. Not even a manual was left behind! The solar array was sitting idle in the sun, and the health clinic was using hand-pumped water carried to the site in buckets.

(The picture above is from that health clinic, and the empty water tank attached to the ill-fated water pump is in the background.)

Situations like this are all too common in the aftermath of short-sighted development projects, and must be avoided if such efforts are to be taken seriously. A sustainable project is more than the hip photo-op aesthetics of a solar array in a small African town. True sustainability must consider the economic impact of the introduction of technological infrastructure, and have sustainable financing schemes built in to account for both the cost of maintenance and the training of community stakeholders. Anything less is a waste of time and money.

=== The Role of Remote Monitoring ===

Development is a difficult process to get rolling in truly sustainable fashion. In theory, a grassroots approach is the preferred strategy, but in practice it often makes more sense to try and spur growth through an initial investment, external or otherwise. Consider the case of renewable energy, if we accept the arguments for its use in a developmental context: Given the economic realities of poverty, the only way to leverage the potential of renewable energy technologies in underdeveloped communities is through charitable investment. It's just too expensive otherwise. So, for the sake of argument, let's assume such investment exists. The problem, then, is how to manage costs after installation. I would argue that if the costs of maintenance can be accounted for in a sustainable way, then use of solar technology can be of enormous economic and social benefit through the income-generating activities it can enable.

Maintenance is a fairly well-defined task in the case of solar energy systems. The essential challenge is the proper cycling of batteries based on available sunlight and expected energy demands. A device that can obtain and analyze information about a solar power system is thus of enormous utility. Furthermore, the easier system diagnostic information is to acquire and distribute, the more reliable and robust the maintenance process becomes. 

Enter remote monitoring. A remote monitoring system can serve as an excellent tool to assist in the maintenance of a solar power system, and that is why I am pursuing this project. Of course, I must stress the auxiliary role of monitoring technologies: *This project is not in any way a substitute for proper training on the maintenance of a solar power system.* However, the chances of long-term success can be greatly improved through the use of remote monitoring because of the quality of information, flexibility, and transparency it can provide. The motivations for the emphasis I place on minimizing after-the-fact costs should be self-evident at this point.

=== Conclusions ===

In summation, solar arrays have enormous up-front costs that tend to be absorbed by development organizations. This is not a desirable state of affairs, nevertheless it is the inexorable reality of the status quo. Despite the magnitude of the initial investment, a properly planned renewable energy initiative can facilitate income-generating activities such as water pumping, communication, lighting, and the operation of electronic appliances. This can lead to sustainable, organic development down the road.

However, there are challenges to overcome in order to sustain progress. The economic benefits of a solar power system must account for the costs of maintenance. As the use of a remote monitoring system would become one of those costs, it needs to be inexpensive. Thus, open source technology is the way to go, because under no circumstances will a proprietary system or third-party service ever be cheap enough. Furthermore, using a third-party service creates an unnecessary external dependency and thus undermines the sustainability of the project. The cost of a monitoring system in this case must be little more than the basic fixed cost of communication. That is my intention with this project and here is how I intend to do it. 

=== Personal Insights and Experience ===

So how did this idea occur to me? Well, the answer to that is related to why I was in the Gambia in the summer of 2007 in the first place. I was helping to build a new high school in the town of Sanyang and my primary contribution to the project was the procurement of resources and the training of community stakeholders on the use of a solar power system to provide the school with electricity. I'm sure everything in the preceding paragraphs makes a ton more sense now. 

Making an incredibly long story short, the solar controller we used for the solar system was donated to us by a company called [http://www.morningstarcorp.com/en/home Morningstar Solar]. It happened to contain a serial RS-232 port that enabled a cellular modem to interface with it and transmit data about the solar power system wirelessly to a remote server. And, unsurprisingly, Morningstar encourages the users of their controllers to interface with their devices in this way. They even offer a remote monitoring service through a third-party that you can pay a pretty penny for. I instantly thought, "Wow, what a useful way to keep up on the progress of the school's power system!" Not only could you do long-term system analysis and telemetry, you could provide the system's local overseers with an easy means to keep up on the progress of the solar array from anywhere at anytime. 

So I looked into the details and found out that the cellular modem required to monitor the solar controller was a whopping $700. And, the fancy web interface provided by the third-party monitoring company would cost about $50 a month. This made the entire thing a non-starter, but I never stopped thinking about how useful it would be if you could actually monitor the solar array remotely. Furthermore, it seemed like such a simple task. Serial communication is not exactly high technology. Cellular telephony is not space-aged, either. Why is it so expensive?

The answer to that is related to the reason that solar panels themselves are so damn expensive to begin with. The demand for solar energy is incredibly high, but there are precious few companies actually mass-producing solar panels. The number of places where a remote monitoring system would make sense is relatively small. And, because solar monitoring is a fairly specialized task, the hardware used by companies that offer telemetry services is often proprietary and customized. So, with the combination of solar energy being already expensive and the fact that the application is limited, the price for solar monitoring systems is basically inflated. 

The expense of existing monitoring systems aside, another problem is the fact that most cellular modems require an external power supply. This is an immediate problem for off-grid systems because it creates a phantom load on the battery bank. Additionally, some solar controllers use Ethernet cables to transfer their data. This requires wired Internet--another impossibility in most off-grid solar applications. Such are the reasons that I intend for this project to be both load-neutral and to use wireless communication. But on that point, another issue arises: Where are the cellular networks in places without electricity?

Fortunately, this problem is already solved, for the most part. In many parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, recent developments in cellular infrastructure have resulted in places with no reliable electrical grid actually being within the range of cell towers. (The paradoxical consequence of this is the fact that you could technically talk on a cell phone but never be able to charge it.) That said, a rural school or hospital running on solar energy is in fact very likely to have a cellular signal. So, remote monitoring via cellular communication can most definitely work in perhaps otherwise electrically isolated communities.

=== Final Thoughts ===

At this point, I've discussed most of the background required to understand the basis and motivation for this project. I want to build an open-source remote monitoring system that uses no customized hardware and software that can run anywhere it is installed. I want to completely eliminate the overhead of paying a third party for monitoring services or using an over-priced custom transmitter. This is a simple problem if money and technological constraints were no object. It becomes an altogether more complicated matter to construct this system with off-the-shelf equipment. But, a little elbow grease and old-fashioned circuit-bending hackery should do the trick, I think. 

At least that's my goal. We'll see what happens...
