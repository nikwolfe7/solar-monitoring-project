== Project Requirements ==

To reiterate, the basic purpose of this project is as follows:

_To design and implement an open-source monitoring system for remote solar energy power systems that can deliver useful diagnostic information to system overseers._ 

This task will be accomplished with the following constraints in mind:

  * The system must not rely on customized hardware`*`, i.e. the parts it uses must be both generic`**` and generally available`***` to anyone looking to reconstruct this project (i.e. any old microprocessor or cheap cell phone.) 
  _(`*`) I do not consider the solar charge controller itself to be a part of this monitoring system because it can function independently of any monitoring activity and is a general requirement of a functional solar power system._

  _(`**`) By "generic", of course, I mean that any adequate microprocessor or device capable of cellular communication can accomplish the tasks required by this project. The notion of an I/O pin, an RS-232 port, a DTMF keypad, an SRAM or an EEPROM, for example, are not specific to any individual type of microprocessor, and are generally available as standard features on a variety of products_

  _(`***`) By "generally available", I mean the products are not specific to a given company or manufacturer. They are mass-produced and can be obtained from various sources._

  * The system must eliminate after-installation costs specific to monitoring, i.e. it must not rely on the payment of a third party for telemetry services. The concept of paying for cellular service or potentially server space are not included in this prohibition, as they are impossible to get around without resorting to illegal measures.

  * The system must be able to be easily configured for any reasonable solar controller providing a serial interface

  * The system must use only open-source software that can run on any server, anywhere. 

This system can be broken into two main components:

1.) A hardware device that interfaces with the solar controller, polls it for information, processes that information into a format that can be transmitted via some telephony communication protocol (I am leaning towards DTMF for the first iteration) and then transmits that data to a remote server or potentially a specific person. 

2.) A software system that will collect the data transmitted, store it for analysis and historical purposes, and allow system diagnostic information be easily displayed via a web interface. For the purposes of dealing with a potential lack of access to computers in some situations, the system will also relay critical information to system overseers via SMS.
