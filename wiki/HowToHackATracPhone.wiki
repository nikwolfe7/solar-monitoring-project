== How to Hack a Cell Phone ==

In order to implement this project's requirement for inexpensive cellular data transmission, I have spent significant time investigating how to hack a cheap cell phone for use in this context. In this series of pages I will discuss how to modify a cellular phone and use it to build a such a transmitter. In this iteration of the project I am using a [http://www.phonescoop.com/phones/phone.php?p=1535 Motorola W260g]. It costs a whopping $15, so don't worry about screwing up if you decide to follow this guide for your own purposes.

=== Part 1: Take it Apart ===

So, first place the phone on the workbench. (Go figure!)

Then remove the back-plate and take the battery out.

Then, using a precision screw-driver (in this case a 1.4mm does the trick), remove the screws from the chassis. This may require using a wrench to get some extra torque because the screws are usually really tight. In this phone there are six. Four of them are located in the battery section of the chassis and two more are located near the bottom, hidden behind rubber stoppers.

Then take out the SIM-card. It is most likely obstructing the plastic chassis from being removed.

Then pop off the back chassis. In my experience this requires wedging the bottom of the phone open with a screwdriver or a knife. Once you get under that it's fairly simple to pull out the whole thing. The speaker and vibrator will be inside the chassis. Their connectors are easily visible on the relative position of the motherboard.

Now, the motherboard of the cell phone should be revealed.

<img src="http://solar-monitoring-project.googlecode.com/svn/img/th_100_0365.jpg" alt="image" height="60%" width="60%"/>

Remove the connector to the LCD screen located at the top of the circuit board. It is a flat square connector attached to a flat ribbon wire.

Then, carefully bending the plastic walls aside that obstruct the external connectors to the USB and the hands-free female jack, pull out the motherboard.

Now you have the motherboard cleanly separated from the phone.

Next, carefully peel off the sticker that holds down the button connectors on the keypad. (Try not to rip it or this becomes a nasty process.)

Now you have an exposed keypad with all of the electrical nodes easily accessible.

Next, we want to take apart the top of the phone in order to remove the LCD screen for later use. First we must remove the screws on the faceplate. There are four, again hidden behind rubber stoppers.

The top of the phone can then be wedged off after these screws have been removed. This requires using a screwdriver or knife to force the plastic plates apart.

Next, remove the other end of the ribbon connector from the LCD screen. 

<img src="http://solar-monitoring-project.googlecode.com/svn/img/th_100_0376.jpg" alt="image" height="60%" width="60%"/>

The LCD screen can then be popped out of its metal chassis with any wedging tool.

Now we've separated the LCD screen from the chassis and can use it later.

Now, to remove the ribbon connector, we need to cut through the plastic in the way.

<img src="http://solar-monitoring-project.googlecode.com/svn/img/th_100_0378.jpg" alt="image" height="60%" width="60%"/>

Remove the ribbon connector. We can use this later to connect the motherboard to the LCD screen without the original plastic body. 

<img src="http://solar-monitoring-project.googlecode.com/svn/img/th_100_0379.jpg" alt="image" height="60%" width="60%"/>

And there you go! We've now completely disassembled the phone to the point where we have access to all of its component parts and can begin hacking!
