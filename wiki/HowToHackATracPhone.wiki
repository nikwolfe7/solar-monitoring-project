== How to Hack a Cell Phone ==

In this series of pages I will discuss how to modify a cellular phone and use it to build a transmitter. In this iteration of the project I am using a [http://www.phonescoop.com/phones/phone.php?p=1535 Motorola W260g]. It costs a whopping $15, so don't worry about screwing up if you decide to follow this guide for your own purposes.

=== Part 1: Take it Apart ===

So, first place the phone the workbench. (Go figure!)

Then remove the back-plate and take the battery out.

Then, using a precision screw-driver, remove the screws from the chassis. This may require using a wrench to get some extra torque because the screws are usually really tight. In this phone there are six. Four of them are located in the battery section of the chassis and two more are located near the bottom, hidden behind rubber stoppers.

Then take out the SIM-card. It is most likely obstructing the plastic chassis from being removed.

Then pop off the back chassis. In my experience this requires wedging the bottom of the phone open with a screwdriver or a knife. Once you get under that it's fairly simple to pull out the whole thing.

Now, the motherboard of the cell phone should be revealed.

Remove the connector to the LCD screen located at the top of the circuit board. It is a flat square connector attached to a flat ribbon wire.
