== How to Hack a Cell Phone ==

In this series of pages I will discuss how to modify a cellular phone and use it to build a transmitter. In this iteration of the project I am using a [http://www.phonescoop.com/phones/phone.php?p=1535 Motorola W260g]. It costs a whopping $15, so don't worry about screwing up if you decide to follow this guide for your own purposes.

=== Part 1: Take it Apart ===

So, first place the phone the workbench. (Go figure!)

Then remove the back-plate and take the battery out.

Then, using a precision screw-driver, remove the screws from the chassis. This may require using a wrench to get some extra torque because the screws are usually really tight.

Then take out the SIM-card. It is most likely obstructing the plastic chassis from being removed.
