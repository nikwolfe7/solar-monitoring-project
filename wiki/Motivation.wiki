=== Why Build This? ===

Why design a solar monitoring system? Indeed, such products already exist on the market. The problem, I believe, with existing solar monitoring systems is that they are limited in their application, are expensive, and in most cases require paying service fees to a third party (above and beyond the cost of basic communication). This sort of system can and should be built using non-custom hardware that can be easily obtained and open-source software that can run anywhere. 

There are many applications for a system like this. Monitoring a solar power array is just one of the possibilities. Practically any device with measurable outputs running in a remote environment represents a potential future extension of this project. And, because this is open-source, anyone who would like to take this project and modify it for their own purposes is free and encouraged to do so. This project provides a general platform for further applications and I hope many people will benefit from the ideas recorded on these pages. 

=== The Bigger Picture ===

In general, remote monitoring is a useful idea. As the world's energy economy gradually evolves towards greener and more renewable sources of energy, power generation will become more [http://www.oe.energy.gov/1165.htm decentralized]. Renewable energy sources are in many ways like mineral resources--they are regional. Sunlight and wind, for instance, vary in their reliability from place to place, and therefore the choice of where to build power systems is as much a function of geography as it is of economics. In contrast to the current system of large, centralized power plants servicing vast regions of energy consumers, the energy infrastructure of the future will see many different forms of power generation taking root wherever the demand exists. Power will not come from 10 or 20 major locations, it will come from potentially thousands. Instead of an enormous coal-fire plant for an entire city, the power of the future will come from solar arrays on the roofs of office buildings, wind turbines on the perimeters of farmland, and steam turbines on remote geothermal vents, just to name a few of the possibilities. 

Coordinating such a vast system will prove impossible without a robust monitoring infrastructure. The ability to measure spot and regional performance is of critical importance if the power of decentralized generation is to be harnessed and the grid is to in fact become [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_grid smarter]. In essence, remote monitoring will be the glue that ties the intelligent grid of the future together.

A real world example of this evolution towards decentralized power generation is Denmark. In the last 20 or so years the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_in_Denmark Danish energy grid] has been transformed from a few large power plants to a vast collection of thousands of wind turbines and alternative energy cooperatives all over the country. Denmark now generates nearly 20% of its energy from wind! And, as expected, the Danish grid requires a vast monitoring system. Today, with the help of remote senors, wind turbines in Denmark are capable of being [http://www.investindk.com/visNyhed.asp?artikelID=21866 monitored] for diagnostic information as minute as the unique vibration pattern of an individual turbine blade. The Danish energy economy is a shining example of both the benefits of decentralization and making the grid smarter through remote monitoring. 

The United States, unfortunately, is far behind Denmark and most of the developed world as far as renewable energy is concerned. Solar and wind technologies have yet to reach the critical mass required for widespread adoption. It is also too expensive without the assistance of energy incentives from utilities. This might be one explanation for the lack of diversity and robustness in monitoring systems. 

This project is an attempt to spur thought and innovation on the use of existing out-of-the-box technologies to accomplish the task of remote monitoring. An open-source development approach, furthermore, is preferable in this situation because it is not large companies, government bodies, or utilities that are making respectable strides towards the adoption of renewable energy--by and large, it is still individuals who are leading the way. I want to support these efforts and assist people taking the initiative to go green. 

I discuss my approach to solving this problem [Requirements here].

=== Inspirational Background ===

At this point I have discussed the importance of monitoring decentralized energy production and the myriad applications for this type of project in the coming "smart grid" revolution. I have not, however, talked about the individual application that inspired my decision to pursue this project. Please read about it [Background here].
