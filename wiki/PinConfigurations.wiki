_Orientation is from left to right_

==Vertical Node 6-Pin Bus==

This is the bus connected to the positive center nodes of the cell phone, the board ground, and the start key.

|| Pin || Value  ||
|| 0   || Ground ||
|| 1   || Power  ||
|| 2   || Node 3 ||
|| 3   || Node 2 ||
|| 4   || Node 1 ||
|| 5   || Start  ||


==Horizontal Node 6-Pin Bus==

This is the bus connected to the circular outer nodes on the keypad that are connected horizontally. 

_N/C means "No Connect"_

|| Pin || Value  ||
|| 0   || Accept ||
|| 1   || N/C    ||
|| 2   || Node A ||
|| 3   || Node B ||
|| 4   || Node C ||
|| 5   || Node D ||

==Digital I/O Pins on the Arduino==

This is the set of wires hooked into the Arduino from the cell phone circuit

_N/C means "No Connect"_
