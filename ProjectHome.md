### Statement of Purpose ###

To design and implement an open-source monitoring system for remote solar energy power systems that can deliver useful diagnostic information to system overseers.

This system is divided into two different parts. The first is a hardware-centric component that interfaces with a solar charge controller to determine diagnostic information about a power system. This component will process obtained data and transmit it via a telephony communication protocol to a server or possibly a specific person.

The second component of the system is the recipient software on the other end of this transfer. This software shall store historical data about the solar system and provide a web interface through which long term statistics can be determined and effective monitoring can be conducted.

This system is intended to be open source, that is, all hardware and software specifications, code, and diagrams will be freely provided and intended for general distribution and use.
